    <p>
      Keeping your furniture clean is <strong>essential</strong> for maintaining a healthy and beautiful home. Regular cleaning prevents wear and keeps your pieces looking new for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start by <strong>dusting</strong> surfaces frequently. Use microfiber cloths for wood, leather, and synthetic fabrics to remove dust and debris without scratching.
    </p>

    <p>
      For stains, act <strong>quickly</strong>. Blot liquids immediately with a clean cloth. For stubborn stains, use <strong>gentle cleaning solutions</strong> designed for the specific material. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage furniture finishes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Protect your furniture with <strong>covers</strong> or pads in high-traffic areas. Rotate cushions regularly to avoid uneven wear, and keep furniture out of direct sunlight to prevent fading.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, remember that <strong>regular maintenance</strong> is easier than deep cleaning later. A little attention each week will preserve your furniture and your peace of mind.
